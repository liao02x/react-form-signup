# React-Form-SignUp showcase

## Overview
This project is a showcase of a form component made with React context and a signup form demonstration. With the help of the React context, the Form can take various types of fields dynamically, and it's with basic styling.

The form is using the html5 required and pattern to validate the input instead of having a schema validator just to keep things simple.

## How to run
1. `pnpm install` to install all the dependencies
2. `pnpm dev` to start the project
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in the browser

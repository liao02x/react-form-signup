# React-Form-SignUp showcase

## Overview
This project is a showcase of a form component made with React context and a signup form demonstration. 

With the help of the React context, the Form can take various types of fields dynamically. Simply having the field component as a child of the Form component and the field would automatically be registered in the form data. Currently, it supports text input field and select field with the support of async loading options.

The form is using the html5 required and pattern to validate the input instead of having a schema validator just to keep things simple.
